Chocolate 3D Printer

Our project was to design a 3D printer that will create chocolate 3D morsels. This will be accomplished using a combination of the Fireball platform with an Arduino control system.  These platforms will be paired with a syringe and chocolate frosting to create our delicious chocolate masterpieces. The overall idea of our system is to be able to upload an already created 3D image into the system, and create a final product that matches the 3D image. The syringe will apply a constant pressure to the chocolate frosting to push the extrudant out of the syringe needle while controling the position of the needle. Every layer of chocolate represents a 2D cross-section of the 3D model. After each layer is deposited, the extruder gets slightly higher to begin building the next layer. 

This project could not be possible with the resources provided by the University of Wisconsin-Milwuakee, specifically the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. More importantly, the technical assistance of Professor Consi and his organization of the mechatronics lab were invaluable. Finally, we acknowledge RichRap of richrap.blogspot.com for providing a framework for the chocolate 3D printer and open source CAD files of the extruder assembly. Without the open source hardware movement, Richrap wouldâ€™ve had no easy way to share his project with the world through Thingiverse.com. 

The goal of this specific project was to create a 3D printer that could produce a pre-defined 3D geometry using chocolate frosting as the extrudant. With safety of operation in mind, the printer must have limit switches to prevent damange to the linear motors/ lead screws and a pressure sensor to shut down the extruder motor when the syringe runs out of chocolate material.
